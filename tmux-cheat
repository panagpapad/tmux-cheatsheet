ctrl + b ---> after bellow commands

w  list windows
n  next window
p  previous window
f  find window
,  name window
&  kill window
To search in the tmux history buffer for the current window, press Ctrl-b [ to enter copy mode.

If you're using emacs key bindings (the default), press Ctrl-s then type the string to search for and press Enter. Press n to search for the same string again. Press Shift-n for reverse search. Press Escape twice to exit copy mode. You can use Ctrl-r to search in the reverse direction. Note that since tmux is in control of the keyboard in copy mode, Ctrl-s works regardless of the stty ixon setting (which I like to have as stty -ixon to enable forward searches in Bash).

If you're using vi key bindings (Ctrl-b:set-window-option -g mode-keys vi), press / then type the string to search for and press Enter. Press n to search for the same string again. Press Shift-n for reverse search as in emacs mode. Press q twice to exit copy mode. You can use ? to search in the reverse direction.
find-window

If you want to switch to a window based on something displayed in it (this also includes window names and titles but not history), (starting with more than one window open) press Ctrl-b f then type the string to search for and press Enter. You will be switched to a window containing that text if it's found. If more than one window matches, you'll see a list to select from.
